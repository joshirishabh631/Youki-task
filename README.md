![Youki Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/youki/main/docs/img/youki-logo.png)
## Overview
In this project, I installed and used the **Youki** container runtime on my **HP EliteBook 820 G3** laptop. The main goal was to explore Youki as an alternative to Docker, and learn about container runtimes.

## Key Features
- **Youki Installation**: Installed Youki as the container runtime on the system.
- **Container Creation & Management**: Learned how to pull, create, and manage containers with Youki.
- **Performance Testing**: Compared CPU usage and performance between Youki and Docker.

## Key Learnings
- **Youki Runtime**: Youki is a lightweight and efficient container runtime that can be a good choice in some cases.
- **Performance Comparison**: Youki used less CPU power and ran faster than Docker for certain tasks.
- **Container Management**: Learned how to create, run, and manage containers from start to finish.

## Challenges Faced
- **Configuration Error**: While setting up Docker with Youki, I accidentally changed some settings, which caused Docker to fail to start. It took some time to fix.

## Results
- Youki was successfully installed and configured.
- Managed containers with Youki and compared its performance to Docker.
- Youki showed better CPU performance and faster execution in some tests.

## Future Work
- **Better Error Handling**: Future improvements can include handling more complex container configurations and issues.
- **Testing More Apps**: I plan to run more applications with Youki to test its performance and compatibility.

## Conclusion
The project was a success. I set up the Youki container runtime and tested its capabilities. Youki is a lightweight and efficient alternative to Docker in certain situations.
